# Focus
A python script to block the most distracting websites.

Here you can block websites which you use the most while working.

say you are working from 10 AM to 5 PM, you can block websites which distract you during this time using a time scdhedule python package.
In my case, I use a productivity tool called rescue time and my code will block websites like facebook, youtube and quora if my productivity score is less than 75.

Motivation of the project:

I have really hard time in managing my day. I always feel that I waste time in some or the other way as I will be always the last gut to submit my assignments and meet deadlines, despite sitting before computer for long time. I have installed rescue time tracker and to my surprise I came to know that I spend most of the time on youtube or quora knowingly or unknowlingly.

Tools and packages used:

this project is built in python using time, schedule,smtplib and selenium python packages.

Selenium: A browser automation tool which I used to scrape my productivity score every hour calculated by rescuetime website.
time package: Used for scheduling the script.
browser: chrome.

I am using it since two days and so far I can say that there is an improvement in my work time.

This is a part of my other project where I designed a system that tracks all my activities and suggests improvments.

This can be used by anyone. All you need is a rescue time account from rescuetime.com which ranks all the websites you have browsed and calculates your productivity.
