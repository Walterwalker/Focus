# Focus
A python script to block the most distracting websites.

Here you can block websites which you use the most while working.

say you are working from 10 AM to 5 PM, you can block websites which distract you during this time using a time scdhedule python package.
In my case, I use a productivity tool called rescue time and my code will block websites like facebook, youtube and quora if my productivity score is less than 75.

Motivation of the project:

I have really hard time in managing my day. I always feel that I waste time in some or the other way as I will be always the last gut to submit my assignments and meet deadlines, despite sitting before computer for long time.

Tools and packages used:
